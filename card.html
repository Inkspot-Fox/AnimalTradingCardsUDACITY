					<p>Honey badgers are a notoriously audacious member of the weasel family.
						They'll eat almost anything, will fearlessly attack nearly any other species when antagonized,
						and their skin is thick and loose enough to be nigh impervious to bee stings and animal bites.
						Their name comes from their fondness for raiding beehives.</p>
